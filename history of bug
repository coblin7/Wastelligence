You can try setting to memory from 128 to 256. And see if that helps.
You can do this by changing gpu_mem=128 to gpu_mem=256 at /boot/config.txt
You can add bcm2708.w1_gpio_pin=18 at the end of the line of boot.txt as shown in the stack exchange link.
/boot/cmdline.txt:
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait bcm2708.w1_gpio_pin=18
